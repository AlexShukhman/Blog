GeistWorks is an agglomeration of three different businesses with three different models, all with the same goal; to leverage the Zeitgeist Model and SOVA to re-evaluate what is possible to send over the internet. GeistWorks intends to take on the challenge of standardizing connections between servers, clients, peers, and connected devices.


## The Zeitgeist Model and SOVA

Simply put, the Zeitgeist Model describes a more flexible, faster, and simpler alternative to ethernet that is capable of communicating over many types of networks, including internet networks like ethernet and WiFi, but also connected device networks like Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave. SOVA is the protocol that a Zeitgeist uses.


## Three Branches

The following are the three branches of GeistWorks that are all required to ensure the stability of the Zeitgeist Model in the software and networking world. Each brings different benefits to the overall business model of the GeistWorks umbrella.


### ZeitNS

ZeitNS is the research branch of GeistWorks and deals mostly in open-source software. While ZeitNS is a cornerstone of the GeistWorks infrastructure, it currently has no business model and intends to be mostly grant- and community-funded. The following are potential product offerings of ZeitNS:



*   Documentation and whitepapers about the Zeitgeist Model and SOVA protocol.
*   Open-source nameserver and embedded network traversal software for use by the community, Dorso, and ZeitHub
*   Open-source plugins for easier use of the SOVA protocol in various coding languages

The ZeitNS products will leverage online open-source software platforms like GitHub. It will, therefore, have a minimal cost related to the payment of maintainers and any costs related to marketing. This means that any team members who work solely within the confines of the ZeitNS branch can be remote, and no overhead for office space or the likes will be required.


### Dorso

Dorso is the hardware arm of GeistWorks and deals mostly in networking hardware. Any custom hardware required for using the SOVA protocol, like hubs, switches, routers, and modems, will be designed and built by this branch of GeistWorks. The product offerings are as follows:



*   Zeitgeist to ethernet hubs
*   Zeitgeist switches, routers, and modems
*   Zeitgeist root name servers
    *   While these can be custom hardware, it doesn’t have to be. Therefore, the value is mostly in the implementation of the software for plug-and-play solutions.
*   ZeitToken assignment hardware (if needed)
*   SOVA to standard protocol converters for connected devices not natively using SOVA
*   Zeitgeist Bluetooth, Z-wave, and Zigbee range extenders

Ideally, Dorso’s hardware will follow Arduino’s approach of using off-the-shelf components in a simple, easy to maintain fashion. Ensuring the use of standard components will lower costs but also a barrier to entry for tinkerers and enthusiasts. Dorso does not intend to be the only provider of the hardware, just the most reliable one.

Dorso will have to start as a co-located team (albeit a small one) for practical purposes, but as the ZeitHub branch’s offerings increase in functionality, it’s highly likely this pattern will change.


### ZeitHub

ZeitHub is a virtual private or public network for sharing hardware and network access. This is a relatively new concept, but it follows a pattern laid out by GitHub (hence the name). Users will be able to offer their networks for tinkerers and early adopters to build plugins even before they have access to the hardware themselves in a sandboxing tool for Zeitgeists. The following are the product offerings of ZeitHub:



*   A web-based application for managing payments and access to networks
*   Native apps for managing connections to networks (like GitHub-flavor Git)
*   A web-based 3rd-party marketplace for plugins to improve ease-of-access to the networks
*   An account with example projects and limited access the most cutting-edge innovations from the two other branches of GeistWorks

ZeitHub, like ZeitNS, is a software-first branch, so it relies on very little overhead with regards to co-located teams. The cost of ZeitHub will be in the development of the code that runs it (most of which will be provided by ZeitNS) and the management of the cloud services offerings. ZeitNS does not intend to be a cloud services provider as its primary revenue source, but that is open to discussion.


## Why

Each branch works in concert with the other two. ZeitNS offers the lifeblood of the product, Dorso the bones, and ZeitHub offers the social aspect and marketing. Without each, the others would fail. ZeitNS would be a money pit offering nothing but intellectual conversation, Dorso would be a competitor to brands like Netgear and D-Link, and ZeitHub would have no benefit over a cloud-services provider.
