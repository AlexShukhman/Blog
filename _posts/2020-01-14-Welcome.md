_Alex's Ideas_ is a space for my personal blog posts and whitepaper-like idea scribblings. I find that I have more ideas for open source software than I know what to do with, here is where I write them down for others to use! Please note, there's usually also a lot less research involved in these posts than there should be. Also, while the ideas I express here are genuinely my own unless noted otherwise, I generally will not have done any prior-art research to ensure that they are, in fact, novel.

## Why?

Frankly, I enjoy thinking that I have all my ideas, digitally dated for IP protection, out there for anyone to use for free! I'm not in the business of stealing ideas, I'm not even in the business of owning them, I just want to be sure that the ideas are available to anyone who wants to build off of them!
